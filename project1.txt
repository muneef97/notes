Storage device in linux :
Fdisk ( get information about disk)  , fdisk /dev/sda, fdisk -l
Mkfs
Fsck (file system check)ir 
Adding a drive - 1. Partition(fdisk) 2. Adding file system(mkfs) 3. Mount (mount)
formating a drive,
What are the root directories -  /dev(files related to the hardware), /etc (stores all configuration files), /opt (space for third party software such as java,program and packages), /proc(currently running processes), /var(contain variable data), /tmp(contain temporary file)
what is file system (file system control how data is stored and retrieved)
What are some of the file   windows(fat, ntfs), linux (ext, ext2, ext 3, ext4)
What is cloud computing ? creating virtual machine on demand in cloud

Computer networking (internet is the biggest computer network): multiple computers are connected to a single computer
Sharing data
subnet - network within a network
Data - documents, picture , video
Types of networks : 
Based on reach/size  : 
LAN(all computers are in the same building),connected by wires
Man ( bigger than lan, all computers in a city)
Wan (biggest computer network, wan is made up of multiple man, larger than 30 miles, eg internet,telephone company)
Parts of a network 
Nodes and communication media(they provide ways to transfer data between nodes)

Server (special computer that many different  users can access) eg amazone web server
Client (getting the service, get a file or data)
server(give the service, give the file or data)
NIC(network interface card) part of the computer that allow to connect to the internet, eth0, esp0s3
Protocol : are the rules for communication,  one person talk at a time, specific messages recieve specific responses
Hyper text transfer protocol, tcp, ip , udp

Topology : bus(very cheap), ring(cost than bus) , star, mesh
Osi model :(open system interconnection ) 
application layer(chrome, firefox,email)
Presentation (os resides in this layer, encrypt data)
Session (conversation between two computers)
Transport (packets are delivered)
Network (determine the route for data)
Data link (nic’s / checking for errors)
Physical (physical medium like cable , fibre optics)

Modem (device that connects your network to the internet),convert digital signals to analog signal
Router
Switch
Repeater (accept small signal and amplify it)

Ip address : to identify each device
Subnet mask
Network ip = ip address AND subnet mask
ip addr add ip/subnet mask
Ip and port are the key to connect to a server
Nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config (to know the port number)
Ufw allow firewall management ,  sudo ufw allow 777/tcp, sudo ufw show added, sudo ufw enable

Apache ( web server)

Dhcp (dynamic host configuration protocol) - automatic assigning of ip address to a system
DNS (domain name system)

YAML :yet another markup language , data representation language
Dictionary (key : value pair),unordered
List (ordered)

JSON(java script object notation): data representation language, used to store and save data

GIT : is a software used to track changes in a project , it helps multiple user work on the same project
Git config --global user.name “asdf”
git config user.name
Git init( initialize git project in a folder)
Git repository is the location were all the files in a project are located
Commit :save the current status of project
Git add .   ,   git commit -m “adding”
Git status
Git log
Git rm file
Git restore file
Git checkout file 
Git hub : website used to make public project, biggest collection of git repositories
git remote add name http
git remote rm name
git push(upload a file)
git pull 
git clone(downlaod a file)









To revise :

Numbers - binary, hexa
32 bit vs 64 bit
Ssd vs hdd(spinning disk) - performance , cost 
Memory vs disk
Terminal vs shell
Authentication vs authorisation

What is git?
What is git repository? How is it created?
What is git commit?
what is a pull request? 
what are branches in git hub ?
